Never liked how the Sheriff's department treated you? Throw this in your server and show them what's what.

Just throw mldeath into your resources folder and start it. There is no code it will start spawning them as soon as you start the resource. To spawn more just restart the resource, and just end it afterwards. WARNING: They do not despawn when you stop the script so they will have to be disposed of in the server.

The mountain lions will spawn in idle_a animation, but do not have any flags. So they will attack if provoked, or run when shots are fired. However they will remain idling until provoked.
